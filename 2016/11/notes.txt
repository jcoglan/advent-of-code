|         | > Aa
| > Aa Bb |   Bb
    1         2

At 2, options are:
  - Go fetch B:
    - Take A down (b protected by B)
    - Take AB up (a protected from B by returning A)

      |   a     | > Aa B
      | > A Bb  |   b

    - At this point, can take a or B down to fetch b, decide:
      - Can use a if
        - there are no a-hostile generators downstairs
      - Can use B if
        - there are no B-vulnerable chips downstairs, and
        - no B-protected chips upstairs (chips vulnerable if you remove B)
      - In this case both are true

  - Go fetch b:
    - Cannot take a down (killed by B)
    - So, take A down
    - Cannot take Ab (A kills b)
    - Cannot take Bb (B kills a)
    - So, just take b

      |   a     | > a b
      | > A Bb  |   A B

    - Less optimal layout, still two items to fetch up



Example playthrough:

|         |       |         |         |         |         |
|   B     |   B   | > Aa B  |   A B   |   A B   |   A B   | > Aa Bb
|   A     | > Aa  |         | > a     |         | > a b   |
| > a b   |   b   |   b     |   b     | > a b   |         |

    Then two options:

    | > Aa  |   a     | > Aa B  |   A B   | > Aa Bb
    |   Bb  | > A Bb  |   b     | > a b   |
    |       |         |         |         |
    |       |         |         |         |

    | > a b   |   b     | > A Bb  |   A B   | > Aa Bb
    |   A B   | > Aa B  |   a     | > a b   |
    |         |         |         |         |
    |         |         |         |         |

Steps:
  - Take movable chip upstairs
  - Take movable pair upstairs
  - Take safe chip down to rescue chip
  - Take safe chip down to rescue chip
  - Take two movable chips upstairs
  - Take two movable chips upstairs
  - Then:
    - Take movable pair upstairs
    - Take movable generator down to rescue generator
    - Take two movable generators upstairs
    - Take safe chip down to rescue chip
    - Take two movable chips upstairs
  - or:
    - Take two movable chips upstairs
    - Take safe chip down
    - Take two movable generators upstairs
    - Take safe chip down to rescue chip
    - Take two movable chips upstairs

Rules:
  - A pair can be moved if
    - there are no vulnerable chips at target
  - A generator can be moved if
    - there are no vulnerable chips at target
    - it does not leave its chip exposed to other generators at source
  - A chip can be moved if
    - its generator exists at target, or
    - there are no other generators at target



Problem playthrough:

|               |               |               |               |

|   b c d e     |   b c d e     |   b c d e

|               |               |

Stuck b/c you can move a up, but then all you can do is move it back down. Can't
use A to go fetch more generators b/c they'll kill a.

Let's backtrace one step and leave the pair where it is, moving generators
instead:

|   b c d e     |   b c d e   |   b c d e   |   b c d e   |   b c d e
